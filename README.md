# OneLineCodingBat

I was bored over the COVID-19 quarantine and decided to do all of the Python CodingBat problems in one line. I had never used Python Ternary operators before even though I had used Python for many years. I had used regular boolean statements with true and false before, but never combining if's, else's and for loops. It was quite fun and I only really struggled with 4 of the problems:

**String-2** 
- [double_char](https://codingbat.com/prob/p170842) 
  - I did not think to use the join method and was trying to figure out how to append everything to a string variable instead of a list

**List-2**
- [sum13](https://codingbat.com/prob/p167025)
  - It was my first time ever using a lambda function and the declaration and usage confused me
- [sum67](https://codingbat.com/prob/p108886)
  - Very similar code to sum13 so I was still a bit confused with the lambda function

**Warmup-2**
- [string_splosion](https://codingbat.com/prob/p118366)
  - Was by far the most difficult, but also the most rewarding. I was trying to append the string slice to a list which ended up joining an empty list and had type errors. After I realised what had happened I was able to fix it and it worked first try
